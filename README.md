# Databricks-portfolio
Currently leveling up into a Databricks + AI platform Engineer. I don't just learn tools - I build, break, fix, document, and iterate until the concepts makes sense in the real world use cases.

This repository contains my hands-on learning, notes, and projects focusing on:

- Databricks notebooks
- Delta Lake (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Unity Catalog governance
- AI & MLflow experimentation

More uploads coming soon.
